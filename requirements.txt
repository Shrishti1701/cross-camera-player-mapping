### Why These Libraries?
torch, torchvision → Core PyTorch for models, tensors, etc.
torchreid → For extracting feature embeddings from crops.
ultralytics → YOLOv8 detections.
scikit-learn → Cosine similarity computation.
pandas → For managing CSVs and dataframes.
opencv-python → Reading/writing images, video processing.
matplotlib → Visualizing matches.
Pillow → Additional image I/O support.
tqdm → Progress bars in loops.
